In the metadata, I chose to record the file name and the ID link to the data in the JSON file to make it easier to return to the original material and keep data well-organized. As this book is an autograph album, I chose to record the names of the signers on each page. As each signature represents a celebrated artist, ranging from poets to painters, who visited Nadar in his studio, I thought it would be important to record their full names and their occupations as artists. Additionally, I recorded the years they lived and when they approximately signed the book, as these details make up the background of the signatures preserved in the autograph album. I also recorded the language/nationality of the artists but since Nadar was located in France, a majority of the signatures are by French artists who predominantly wrote in French. Finally, I categorized the page's details/drawings to describe what the artists illustrated in the book beyond just their own signature. These categories included poems and scores of music.
